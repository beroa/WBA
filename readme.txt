World Boss Attendance

WBA creates a simple UI panel which displays all of your guild members which are in certain zones. By default these zones are {"Ashenvale", "Feralas", "The Hinterlands", "Duskwood", "Azshara", "Blasted Lands"} and to change them, for now you'd have to change the code.

It makes it easy to take a screenshot of who, in your guild, attended the world boss, and it will all fit in a single screenshot unlike using the default guild viewer.

Usage
WBA scans your guilds location at most every 5 seconds when the main window is open and displays the information in the window.

Slash Commands
